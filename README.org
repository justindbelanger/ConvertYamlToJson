* Motivation
** Primary
This script demonstrates converting YAML files to JSON files.
** Secondary
It also demonstrates executing C# code as a script! How awesome is this? Checkout [[http://scriptcs.net/][ScriptCS]] for one popular tool for C# scripting. Also--and perhaps more importantly--there's a tool that is built into the .NET Framework, [[https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Interactive-Window#repl][csi.exe]], that allows [[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/mt614271.aspx][interactively scripting in C#]].
* Usage
** ScriptCS
If you want to use ScriptCS, just install it (perhaps via Chocolatey), then run
#+BEGIN_SRC powershell
scriptcs ConvertYamlToJson.csx -- "FileName.yaml"
#+END_SRC
** csi.exe
For csi.exe, you must first run 
#+BEGIN_SRC powershell
.\restore_packages.ps1
#+END_SRC
 once to restore NuGet packages, then you can run 
#+BEGIN_SRC powershell
csi ConvertYamlToJson.csx "FileName.yaml"
#+END_SRC

You might have to ensure NuGet and/or some other tools are installed system-wide, first.
